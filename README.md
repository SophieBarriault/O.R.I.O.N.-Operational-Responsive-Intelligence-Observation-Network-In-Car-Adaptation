# O.R.I.O.N.-Operational-Responsive-Intelligence-Observation-Network-In-Car-Adaptation 

This project is a mini passion project of mine where I'm trying to plan out how to make a in-car adpatation of my O.R.I.O.N., JARVIS, inspired model for an in-car adaptation, given with the right tools and hardware at my disposal. This is more of a proposal than anything, and it gives me a way to practice, and learn more about, C++ and ML model adpatation. 

I will continue to work on this project, however bringing this adaptation into real life may be tricky as I do not currently have access to some of the materials needed. As of currently, this project is being used to help exercise my programming skills mainly.
