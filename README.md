## 🌟 About the Project

This project is a mini passion project of mine where I'm trying to plan out how to make a in-car adpatation of my O.R.I.O.N., JARVIS, inspired model for an in-car adaptation, given with the right tools and hardware at my disposal. This is more of a proposal than anything, and it gives me a way to practice, and learn more about, C++ and ML model adpatation. 

I will continue to work on this project, however bringing this adaptation into real life may be tricky as I do not currently have access to some of the materials needed. As of currently, this project is being used to help exercise my programming skills mainly.

### 👾 Tech Stack 

**Arduino IDE:** 

 - ESP32 Board Support

 - TensorFlow Lite Micro

 - ESP32 I2S library

 - SPI + CAN library

### 🎯 Features

**Voice-Activated Wake Word:**
 - Automatically activates when you say "Orion", no buttons needed.

**Speech Recognition:** 
 - Converts your spoken words into text using SpeechRecognition and PyAudio.

**Conversational AI:** 
 - Processes questions and commands using Hugging Face’s Mistral-7B-Instruct model (fully customizable).

**Text-to-Speech Response:** 
 - ORION responds with a natural-sounding voice using pyttsx3.

**Dynamic UI Console:** 
 - Displays real-time updates, user inputs, and responses with animated GIF integration via tkinter.

**Continuous Listening Loop:** 
 - After responding, ORION returns to standby and waits for the next command.

**Customizable Wake Word & Voice Settings:** 
 - Easily change the assistant’s wake word, voice, rate, and language settings in the source code.

**Privacy-First:** 
 - No user data is stored by default. All processing is ephemeral unless logging is added intentionally.
